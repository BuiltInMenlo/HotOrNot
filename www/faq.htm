			<li>Why is my selfie required? Think of this as your social ID. You must have a selfie to be apart of the Volley community.</li>
			<li>What is Verify and how do I become Verified? You become Verified once other members of the Volley community have given you a positive selfie score of 10+ or more. Note that you will be notified as soon as this happens.</li>
			<li>How do I flag users who look fake? The Verify section is where you flag users who look fake. You can also flag their profile or any Volley hashtag they are apart of if you think they are being offensive and/or inappropriate.</li>
			<li>Why is Volley only for 14-19 year olds? At this time Volley is focusing on making a network safe for this age range. We will be opening up to other age ranges as we scale.</li>
			<li>How does Volley handle people who lie about their age and or profile image? Our community and internal staff are constantly monitoring our Verify section. If you lie about your age or try to get around the selfie photo requirements you will be suspended generally with 6 to 8 hours.</li>
			<li>We take teen social privacy and security seriously. We are building the first network that makes it impossible to lie about your age and or identity.</li>
			<li>Remember have fun, take selfies and invite your friends. This is the first community where you say who stays and who goes.</li>
